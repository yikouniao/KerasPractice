# KerasPractice
The practice of Keras and DL.

## Firstly
I'm starting to learn Deep Learning and seeing if it is useful for my research on MOT.
It's really exciting that I finally take the next step forward.
The future is anticipated. Learning is a bitter but happy thing.
As time goes by, maybe what I write in this repository can be more and more interesting,
challenging as well as useful.

OK, that's it. Let's begin.

## MNIST Classification
In `./mnist_classification/mnist_classification.py`.

MNIST is a dataset containing 60,000 greyscale images of 10 digits together with
10,000 test samples.
All images are 28*28 in size.
CNN has done a very good job in classifying MNIST dataset.
Keras also take it as an example in its Github repository.
Let's re-write this task as the first try of CNN.

`Test loss: 0.02846`, `test accuracy: 0.9904`, quite excellent.
