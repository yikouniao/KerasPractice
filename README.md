# KerasPractice
The practice of Keras and DL.

## MNIST Classification
In `./mnist_classification/mnist_classification.py`.

MNIST is a dataset containing 60,000 greyscale images of 10 digits together with
10,000 test samples.
All images are 28*28 in size.
CNN has done a very good job in classifying MNIST dataset.
Keras also take it as an example in its Github repository.
Let's re-write this task as the first try of CNN.

`Test loss: 0.02846`, `test accuracy: 0.9904`, quite excellent.

## MNIST VAE
In `./mnist_vae/mnist_vae.py`.

Variational AutoEncoder on MNIST.

## Person Re-Identification
No time to do the practice any more. It's time to exploit neural network for person tracking.
